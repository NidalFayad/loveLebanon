      <h1>MOST POPULAR LEBANESE DISHES</h1><br>


      <h2>Hummus</h2>
      <p>This internationally popular, beige-colored spread is traditionally made with mashed chickpeas, tahini sesame paste, lemon juice, and garlic. People across the world love hummus for its tangy flavor and the fact that it is filled with
        nutrients. When served, it is typically dressed with a drizzle of olive oil, and is then used as a dip for vegetables or a flavorful filling for flatbreads such as pita. Even today, not much is known about its origins, although the earliest
        mention of
        hummus dates back to 13th-century Egypt. Hummus is sometimes additionally enriched with spices such as cumin and paprika, and it can be garnished with anything from fresh herbs, cucumbers, and chopped tomatoes to olives, pine nuts, and
        hard-boiled eggs.</p>

      <h2>Shawarma</h2>
      <p>Marinated and spit-roasted, shawarma is a delicious Middle Eastern meat treat whose origins can be traced back to the Ottoman Empire era, while its name stems from the Arabic pronunciation of the Turkish word çevirme (lit. to turn;
        turning), and refers to the rotating skewer on which the meat is cooked. Shawarmas are made with either lamb, turkey, chicken, beef, or a mix of different meats which are slow-cooked for hours and basted in their own juices and fat, gaining
        an incomparable succulence, but the real secret to a perfect shawarma is
        in the marinade. Depending on the variety, the meat must be marinated for at least a day, preferably two, especially when using beef. These marinades are either yogurt or vinegar-based and typically include spices and flavorings such as
        cinnamon, cloves,
        cardamom, nutmeg, black pepper, allspice, dried lime, spicy paprika, garlic, ginger, lemon, bay leaf, and sometimes even orange slices. Shawarma is traditionally served either on its own or enjoyed tucked inside a warm flatbread such as
        pita or lavash. However, what really sets it apart from the Turkish döner kebab, Greek gyros, or other similar foods is the extent of
        garnishes and condiments offered with it.</p>

      <h2>Tabbouleh</h2>
      <p>Tabbouleh is a colorful Lebanese national dish that is usually considered a salad, with a crunchy and chewy texture, made with fresh, finely chopped parsley leaves, olive oil, bulgur wheat, and chopped mint leaves as a base. It originated
        in the mountains of Lebanon and Syria, where edible herbs that are used in tabbouleh were consumed by Arabs since Medieval times.
        Usually served as an appetizer, it is sometimes accompanied by pita bread, baba ghanoush, or hummus. Chopped red tomatoes, diced cucumbers, fresh lemon juice and minced onions can be added to the salad, imparting a tangy flavor. It is best
        to refrigerate tabbouleh for a few hours before serving to improve its taste.
        Its refreshing flavors are ideal for a hot summer day, while bulgur provides a rich source of fiber, protein, and minerals, making tabbouleh one of the healthiest food options in Lebanon. Tabbouleh is so popular that it even has its own
        day, celebrated every year on the first Saturday in July.</p>

      <h2>Fattoush</h2>
      <p>Fattoush is a simple salad made with traditional pita bread as a base on which the rest of the ingredients are built on. Pita bread is torn or cut into small bite-sized pieces, then toasted, grilled, or fried. It is then mixed with a
        variety of vegetables such as lettuce, radish, crunchy cucumbers, cherry tomatoes or regular tomatoes, peppers, onions, and (occasionally) garlic.
        All ingredients are chopped and cut into pieces and mixed with a generous amount of herbs, most commonly mint and parsley. The final touch to this authentic salad is the dressing, usually made with olive oil, lemon juice, and pomegranate
        syrup. The key ingredient, next to the crunchy pita bread, is sumac - a spice commonly used in the Levantine area.
        Sumac can be added to the dressing, and it is usually sprinkled on top of a prepared salad. It gives the dish a slightly tart taste and zest, which perfectly matches with the gentle flavors and aromas of fresh herbs and vegetables. The
        original fattoush is highly versatile, and other common additions may include crisp pomegranate seeds, olives, yogurt, and feta cheese.
        It is one of the most famous salads frequently eaten in Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Iraq. This refreshing salad belongs to a group of dishes popularly called fattat, which use the stale pita, or any other flatbread, as
        the star ingredient.</p>

      <h2>Manakish</h2>
      <p>Manakish is a favorite Lebanese breakfast - a round, flat bread that is typically topped with olive oil and zaatar (sesame seeds, thyme, and sumac), then baked in the oven. Other toppings might include cheese, minced lamb, spinach, or
        fried eggplants.
        The name of the dish means decorated or stamped, referring to a technique where the dough is pressed using the tips of one's fingers, leaving a decorative pattern in the process. Although it is sometimes affectionately called Lebanese
        pizza, it is a recent addition to the Lebanese culinary heritage, but it quickly became one of the most popular dishes due to its flavors, low price, and the ease of preparation.
        Manakish is often associated with being food for the poor, but it is enjoyed by all classes of society. It is recommended to pair it with tomatoes, cucumbers, yogurt cheese, or a cup of hot tea.</p>
