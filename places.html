        <h2>Downtown Beirut</h2>
        <p>Most Lebanese people have visited Downtown Beirut to marvel. It is a great place for shopping and high-end vibes. Many flock here for brunch, or just to walk around. The district is full of things to see, and speaks to what locals think
          Lebanon could be.</p>
        <img src="https://cdn.theculturetrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/10298125976_2706bbba80_k-e1493194004829.jpg" alt="">

        <h2>Martyrs' Square, Beirut</h2>
        <p>Another site in Downtown Beirut, Martyrs’ Square is the pride of the Lebanese and encompasses the country’s history. It is a memorial to all those who were killed during Ottoman rule, and continues to hold significance with the
          assassination of Lebanese leaders. The square was a dividing line in Beirut during the Civil War, and is now a focal point for protests.</p>

      <h2>Baalbek</h2>
      <p>Baalbek is an endless source of pride for the Lebanese. It is home to one of the only well-preserved historical sites in the country, the Roman Ruins. Baalbek was inhabited as early as 9000 BCE. It is the site of ancient temples — the home
        of Venus, Ishtar and Bacchus — and is an archaeological wonder. Don’t miss out on this little piece of history as it was a cornerstone of ancient civilizations.</p>

      <h2>Jeita</h2>
      <p>Another national treasure is the Grotto in Jeita, a natural rock formation made from a curious chain of caves. There’s unlikely to be a school in the country that hasn’t taken its students there, or a student who hasn’t studied it in
        geography class. This is definitely a must-see place when visiting Lebanon.</p>

      <h2>Jbeil, Byblos</h2>
      <p>This coastal city is definitely in most Lebanese people’s weekend plans. Its most famous asset is the Old Souks and castle in the center. During the day, Jbeil is a tourist hot-spot and at night it turns into a big party, with vibrant pubs
        and nightlife.</p>

      <h2>Cedars, Mt. Lebanon</h2>
      <p>The Cedars of God are definitely the crown jewel of Lebanese identity. The cedar tree is on the flag to represent the country’s history and immortality. The site itself is a ski resort/hiking trail visited by Lebanese and foreigners
        year-round. The trees are protected by the government and the UN.</p>

      <h2>Tannourine</h2>
      <p>Tannourine is the site of much of Lebanon’s water supply. It is rich in resources and home of the famous Baatara Gorge waterfall, which is a natural treasure. Not many Lebanese Instagram feeds are missing a picture of this picturesque
        enclave.</p>
